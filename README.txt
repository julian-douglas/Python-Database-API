# Python-Database-API

Welcome to the Python Database API!

This is a program that allows a user to use a database of University of Bath employees. When the program is executed, the user has eight options:

1. Create a database (called EmployeeUoB)
2. Insert a record into the database
3. View all records in the database
4. Search for an employee by ID, name, etc
5. Update a record
6. Delete a record
7. Return a list of employees whose salary is higher than an input
8. Exit the program. 

Each record consists of a unique user ID, title, forename, surname, email address, and salary.
